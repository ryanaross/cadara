## ADDED Requirements

### Requirement: OCC adapter implements the public modeling contract without frontend leakage
An OpenCascade-backed kernel adapter SHALL satisfy the public modeling contract through the documented adapter surface and SHALL not take ownership of frontend interaction concerns.

#### Scenario: OCC adapter serves modeling operations
- **WHEN** the application uses an OCC-backed kernel adapter for snapshot, sketch commit, feature operations, preview evaluation, or reference resolution
- **THEN** the adapter responds in the public modeling contract shape rather than exposing OCC-specific UI workflows or kernel internals to frontend components

#### Scenario: Frontend performs interactive editing
- **WHEN** the user performs pointer-driven drafting, hover interaction, toolbar changes, or local previews
- **THEN** those concerns remain outside the OCC adapter and are not modeled as kernel-owned interaction APIs

### Requirement: OCC adapter preserves clear separation between public contract data and internal kernel state
An OpenCascade-backed kernel adapter SHALL keep internal OCC-only geometry and bookkeeping private when the public contract does not expose that data, while still returning contract-valid snapshots, diagnostics, and render exports.

#### Scenario: Construction plane requires internal plane geometry
- **WHEN** the adapter needs explicit geometric plane data to rebuild or resolve an internal OCC construction plane but the public snapshot does not expose that geometry
- **THEN** the adapter keeps that internal representation private and still returns the public construction snapshot shape defined by the modeling contract

#### Scenario: Adapter rebuilds committed authoring state
- **WHEN** the adapter evaluates an accepted document mutation
- **THEN** it rebuilds authoritative committed model state from durable authoring data and returns only contract-valid results to the frontend

### Requirement: OCC adapter rejects unsupported contract gaps explicitly
An OpenCascade-backed kernel adapter SHALL reject public-contract cases that are not faithfully implementable from the documented contract instead of inventing hidden OCC-specific semantics.

#### Scenario: Revolve uses a construction-backed axis that is not publicly representable
- **WHEN** a revolve request uses a construction-backed axis that the public contract does not define precisely enough to reconstruct
- **THEN** the adapter returns structured diagnostics or rejection rather than inferring an axis from hidden implementation rules

#### Scenario: Committed region reconstruction depends on unavailable projected geometry
- **WHEN** feature execution requires projected sketch geometry that is not reconstructible from the committed public contract
- **THEN** the adapter rejects the operation explicitly and reports the contract limitation to the caller
